1. need to setup parameters in cli to utilize clearml - DONE
1. define simplified experiment (minimal randomization) - DONE
1. fix offroad flag on lane change - DONE
1. in reward give only static far away target and remove other rewards DONE
1. try without cars - DONE
1. add time penalty on opposit lane - DONE
1. change passed condition (pass obstacle and enter original lane)
1. change vehicle spawning
1. solve simple environemnt - DONE
1. solve env on broader range - DONE

evaluation on larger ranges:
problem is too easy, range scale of 2X still easily solvable.
ideas to make problem harder:

1. play with bicycle model car length - DONE, hard to get noticable effect
1. add action noise
1. more varied density, so agent HAS to wait behind obstacle
1. when randomizing obstacle, try again if obstacle make the environemnt un-beatable
